Credits
-------

Several ideas on the code structure/layout for this application
were borrowed from Bloog <http://bloog.billkatz.com/>, which is
another GAE-based blog.

This application makes use of several 3rd party libraries.
The following libraries are included:

* python-markdown2
* Pygments
* Dateutil
* smartypants
* pytz

Building this blog was much easier because of the authors of
those libraries.  Thanks!
